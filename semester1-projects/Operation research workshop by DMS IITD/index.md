# Operation Research workshop by Department of Management Studies

## Definition
Operation Research is the discipline which deals with contraint optimization

## Solving Optimization Problems
1. By Reformulation -> Linear (infinite solution) -> Quadratic convex (Single minima) -> Linear Piecewise solution
2. Contraint reformulation or elimination
3. Reformulation of logical constraints
4. Mix Integer Programming Problems (MIPs)
5. Use of Big M
6. Branch and Bound Solver
7. MCDM Approach
8. Mathematical formulation - DFJ (Danzig fulkerson Johnson), MTZ(Miller Tucker Zemlin)
9. Subtour Elimination strategies - Papers by Archetti et al, Coehelo et al
10. MILP - Multi-Integer Linear Programming
11. Branch and Cut


## Type of Problems
1. Scheduling Problems (IPL scheduling)
2. Column Generation Problems
3. Flight scheduling Problems
4. Procurement Problems : How much, what, how to, When to procure
5. TSP - Travelling Salesman Problem
6. VRP - Vehicle Routing Problems
7. IRP - Inventory Routing Problems (Artificial Insemination Injection protection in Nasik)
8. PRP - Production routing Problem
9. VMI based problem - where supplier is responsible for optimization
10. Nash Games vs Stackelberg games (sequential Games)
11. Product Line Selection, Interdiction, Protection problems, Resilient Design Problems
