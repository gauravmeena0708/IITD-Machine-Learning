My Personal Approach to Reading Books

Recently, a thoughtful reader reached out with a great question: how do you approach reading books, especially when trying to master a topic? It’s a fantastic question, and as I reflected on my own habits, I realized that my reading style is a mix of deliberate focus and delightful randomness. Let me share some of my personal guidelines and quirks around reading—developed over years of trial and error.

    On Picking Books: A Mix of Strategy and Serendipity. While I sometimes start with a well-chosen book to gain an overview of a topic, my approach isn’t always that methodical. I love downloading lots of Kindle samples and “snooping around” to see what catches my interest. It’s like treasure hunting—you never know what gem might pique your curiosity! When I’m intrigued by an area, say generative AI, I keep my eyes open for recommendations or books that align with that theme. But often, it’s a bit random, and that’s part of the fun!

    Reading the Whole Book vs. Summaries. I’m not a fan of summaries—they often miss the depth that makes a book truly valuable. That said, I don’t feel the need to read every single word, either. Instead, I focus on the sections that resonate with me and skim through the rest. This keeps me engaged while still capturing the insights I’m looking for.

    The Value of Finishing BooksI don’t finish every book I start—far from it! In fact, I often finish only one in five. But when a book feels foundational or deeply inspiring, I make a deliberate effort to see it through. Finishing certain books helps deepen my understanding and builds the discipline to stay committed when it really matters.

    When Reading Feels Hard. We all go through times when reading feels like a slog. I’ve had stretches of months where I just can’t seem to focus. During those times, I set tiny goals—like reading just one page or a small percentage of a book on my Kindle. These little steps help me stay in the habit without feeling overwhelmed.

Additional Tips for Enjoyable and Effective Reading

    Embrace randomness: Don’t be afraid to explore books that seem interesting, even if they’re not part of a plan. Sometimes the most rewarding discoveries are unplanned!

    Use active recall: Pause occasionally to reflect on or summarize what you’ve read. It’s a great way to absorb ideas more deeply.

    Layer your learning: Combine reading with other activities, like discussing the ideas with others or putting them into practice.

For me, reading isn’t just about learning—it’s about curiosity, exploration, and enjoying the journey. Whether your approach is random, deliberate, or somewhere in between, the key is to keep turning the pages and see where they lead you.

How Leaders Can Harness the Science of Learning

My two-part interview on The Good Leadership Podcast with Charles Good is now available! In these episodes, we explore how the science of learning can help leaders and teams apply strategies like active recall, interleaving, and self-monitoring to tackle challenges and drive meaningful results. We also discuss how to avoid outdated learning strategies like passive reading and cramming, and instead focus on techniques that truly make learning stick. Here’s Part I and Part II. It’s a conversation I truly enjoyed, and I hope you find it just as valuable!
